# Flower-Species-Classification-CNN

A deep learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify flower species from images. Trained on the **TensorFlow Flowers dataset**, this model learns to accurately identify five different flower types using end-to-end supervised learning.

## ðŸŒ¸ Project Overview

This project implements a custom CNN architecture to classify color images of five flower species. It leverages the TensorFlow/Keras framework to build, train, and evaluate a model using image data sourced from the publicly available `tf_flowers` dataset.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical image classification using CNNs and gain experience in managing image preprocessing, model tuning, and performance evaluation in a computer vision context.
